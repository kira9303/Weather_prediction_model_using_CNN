# Weather_prediction_model_using_CNN
For now, The model will start training itself on three classes, Sunrise, Cloudy and Rainy. GO ahead for further instructions.

1) I've included two .py files, Running the weather_prediction.py will start training the model that you'll be using for predicting the weather, The code contains constraints for only three types of weather conditions for now.

2) Next, Once the model is trained, place the model i.e (.h5) file in the same directory you're working it. Further, Place the 'weather_implementation_script.py' in the same directory as the (.h5) model as well.

3)Run the 'weather_implementaion_script.py', It will ask you the number of images you would like to predict and then, The file path to those images, One by one. Enjoy! : )


NOTE:- If you don't wanna go through the lengthy process of training from scratch, I've uploaded a (.h5) trained model too!. Paste it in the same directory as 'weather_implementation_script.py' and just run the 'weather_implementaion_script.py' script!. 


Feel free to modify the code!, Also, Feel free to download any image of following category, 'Sunrise, Cloudy and Rainy' from Google and test it on the model for prediction!.
